# Reflection for Week Three

This week I learned a lot about the tidying of data and the visualizations of digital history projects. The data analysis and reformation is part of what James Barker refers to as "soft history". This is the work that defines the final digital work, but is not itself part of that final work. 

Performing this "soft history" is an integral part of the digital history process. For Barker's project on the making and selling of satirical prints in London in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, he says his process of mapping the businesses associated with the prints gave him a sense of what he cared to produce in his project. This is such as when I was playing around with the different networking toold on Gephi and RStudio. Each plot visualizes uniquely and thus prioritizes different information. 

Barker created two visualizations which I will show below. In the one the blue dots representing the stationers are everywhere. Barker commentd what he noticed "was that I could not see any patterns because the stationers dominated the visual field." Using different variations and visualization techniques allow different patterns to appear. Without the starioners, Barker was able to identify a relationship.

But the processes of "soft history" begin way before this. Using REGEX in Sublime and Open Refine, I went through and tidied up the data.
