# Notes for Week Three

- the 'soft' history refers to the visual results of the data analysis

- the 'hard' history is the analytical thinking of what this means

- the addition of layers int he visuals - in this case the stationers - allows for a better visualization of patterns

- the thinking flowed for the makinng of the maps but the maps are not included in the actual book

- the 'soft/hidden' history is the digital history that didn't make it into the book

- the 'hard/visible' history is wha made its way into the book because it supported the author's interpretation

- use of both specfic and generic spatial information
