- not entirely sure why but replacing \n[^~.+] with \n only took away some of the material that wasn't letters. I had to run it a second time for them all to be gone

- I used the search function in both the original file and the condensed file to fix this line ...

  - I oculd tell there was a 'to' in the line and therefore ould be considered a letter; however, there was a typo in spacing that didn't allow for this 'to' to come up as a search result. Thus, I fixed it manually.
